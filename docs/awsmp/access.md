# Access Guide

> This software product is delivered without TLS (Transport Layer Security) configured by default.
> If access from the public internet is required, it is strongly recommended to follow the best practices of configuring HTTPS access.

As soon as the AWS CloudFormation stack of EPAM Syndicate Rightsizer changed 
its state to `CREATE_COMPLETE` you can access the product in the following ways:

### CLI
To access the EPAM Syndicate Rightsizer's CLI please follow these steps:
1. Verify if the inbound/outbound SSH traffic is allowed to port 22 by the 
Security Group that is applied to the product instance;
2. Make sure that you have the SSH key used while instance provisioning;
3. Ensure the key file has read-only permission for the owner or file user.
If not, set such permission with the command: `chmod 400 $SSH_KEY_NAME` where 
`$SSH_KEY_NAME` is replaced with the actual ssh key file name. 
4. Connect to the product instance using the SSH key using this command: 
`ssh -i $SSH_KEY_NAME admin@$INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS` where:
   - `$SSH_KEY_NAME` is the actual name of the key file;
   - `$INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS` is the actual public DNS of the instance.
5. After you successfully log in check if the syndicate CLI is available with the 
command `syndicate --version`.

Security Group that is applied to the product instance;
